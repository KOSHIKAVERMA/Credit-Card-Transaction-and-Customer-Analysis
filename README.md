# Credit-Card-Transaction-and-Customer-Analysis

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project, I uncovered key insights and behavioral patterns in credit card usage using Power BI. I analyzed crucial metrics such as customer age, sexual orientation, marital status, occupation, and education level. By the end, I gained a clearer understanding of how customers use their credit cards, enabling me to predict their needs and provide meaningful insights.
