# Unlocking Insights: Credit Card Transactions and Customer Behavior Analysis
<br>

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project, I uncovered key insights and behavioral patterns in credit card usage using Power BI. I analyzed crucial metrics such as customer age, sexual orientation, marital status, occupation, and education level. By the end, I gained a clearer understanding of how customers use their credit cards, enabling me to predict their needs and provide meaningful insights to the company.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

In this project, I analyzed data from a fictional credit card company aiming to understand business performance and customer usage patterns across all **four quarters** of the **2023** financial year. The goal was to identify key trends and highlight areas requiring the most attention to optimize their operations effectively.

## DATA CLEANING

After importing the files in power BI, I initiated to check for any discrepancies in the data. All the **data types** were correct accept for the **date** column so, I changed it to date. 

Then I checked for any **duplicates** or **empty values** using the **column distribution** and **column quality** features in the data preview group, but there were no duplicates and empty values in the data. 

<br>

## DATA MODELLING

Before starting the analysis and visualization, I created some **additional columns** and **measures** to streamline certain processes. I utilized Power BI's built-in **DAX** tool to develop these enhancements.

**a) ADDED COLUMNS**

**1. Revenue**

I created a new column to calculate the revenue of customers by adding the annual fees they have paid, the total amount of money generated by their transactions, and the interest earned by the company.

```dax
Revenue = credit_card[Annual_Fees] + credit_card[Total_Trans_Amt] + credit_card[Interest_Earned]
```

**2. Week Number**

I created an additional column to show the weeks by number eg: 1,2,3,etc,.

```dax
Week_num_2 = WEEKNUM( credit_card[Week_Start_Date])
```

**3. Age Group**

I created a column for age group in which I grouped the age of customers in equal age differences to make the analysis more meaningful, the groups included all the ages from 21 to 73  

```dax
Age_Group = SWITCH( 
    true(),
     customer[Customer_Age] < 30, "20-30" ,
     customer[Customer_Age] >= 30 && customer[Customer_Age] < 40, "30-40",
     customer[Customer_Age] >= 40 && customer[Customer_Age] < 50, "40-50",
     customer[Customer_Age] >= 50 && customer[Customer_Age] < 60, "50-60",
     customer[Customer_Age] >= 60, "60+",
      "unknown"
)
```

**4. Income Group**

I created a separate column to group the income in "low", "medium", and "high" income levels to understand customer's credit card' usage trends based on their income levels. 

```dax
Income_Group = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    customer[Income] < 35000, "Low",
    customer[Income] >= 35000 && customer[Income] < 70000, "Med",
    customer[Income] >= 70000, "High",
    "unknown"
)
```

<br>

**b) MEASURES**

I developed several key measures to analyze revenue on a **weekly basis**. 

**1. Current_week_revenue**

Current week revenue refers to the **total revenue generated during the most recent or ongoing week**. I calculated the current week's revenue measure using **calculate()** function by **summing** the revenue column and filtering the data using **max()** to only include rows where the week number matches the maximum week number to calculate the most recent week's revenue.  

```dax
Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM( credit_card[Revenue]), 
    FILTER(
        ALL(credit_card),
        credit_card[Week_num_2] = MAX(credit_card[Week_num_2])))
```

**2. Previous_week_revenue**

Previous week revenue refers to the **total revenue generated during the week immediately before the current one**. It helps in comparing performance week-over-week.
The only change in this formula is the filter condition. I have **subtracted 1 from the max()** function to target the previous week’s data. This ensured the calculation reflected revenue from the week immediately before the current one.

```dax
Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM( credit_card[Revenue]), 
    FILTER(
        ALL(credit_card),
        credit_card[Week_num_2] = MAX(credit_card[Week_num_2])-1))
```

**3. WOW_Revenue**

Week-on-week (WoW) revenue measures the **change in revenue from one week to the next**. It shows the **difference in earnings compared to the previous week**. I calculated the week on week revenue by dividing the current week' revenue by the previous week's revenue. 

```dax
WOW_Revenue = DIVIDE(([Current_week_Revenue] - [Previous_week_Revenue]), [Previous_week_Revenue])
```
<br>

### Note:

All these visualisations and their insights are generated after I added an additional week's data (31st Dec,2023 - 06th Jan,2024) using Power BI's append queries feature and then refreshing the dashboards. This demonstrated Power BI's ability to dynamically adjust insights and metrics in real-time, ensuring that the analysis remains up-to-date with the most current data.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Optimize Blue and Silver Card Offerings**: Since these cards generate the most revenue, focusing on enhancing the rewards programs can retain high-usage customers.
  
- **Payment methods**: Focus on maintaining and improving swipe transaction experiences. However, as digital payment methods (chip and online) are growing, it’s still beneficial to offer incentives or enhancements in those areas to cater to evolving customer preferences while maintaining a strong swipe infrastructure.

- **Increase Focus on Middle-Aged Customers**: Customers aged 40-50 contribute the highest revenue, so targeting this group with tailored financial products or loyalty programs can boost engagement.
  
- **Boost Female Customer Participation**: While male customers generate slightly more revenue, focusing on expanding female engagement could increase overall revenue, especially in high-income segments.

- **Address High Delinquency in Self-Employed**: Provide better financial education, flexible payment options, or incentives to self-employed customers to reduce delinquency rates.

- **Enhance Card Activation Rates**: Since the activation rate is just above 57%, offering promotions or reminders could increase activation within the first 30 days, improving early engagement.

## CONCLUSION

This project successfully analyzed credit card transactions and customer behavior, revealing key trends and insights. The **Blue and Silver cards** dominate transactions, contributing significantly to revenue, while **male customers** in high-income groups drive higher spending. The report highlighted regional contributions, with **TX, NY, and CA** leading the revenue share. Additionally, middle-aged customers were identified as major contributors, and there is potential to improve **card activation rates** and reduce **delinquency rates**. These insights and recommendations can guide strategic decisions to optimize product offerings, target key customer segments, and boost overall performance.
